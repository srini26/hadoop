Pig Commands by Example :

 
 pig -brief									// launches the pig interactive console called grunt
 grunt> 
	fs -cat /pigfiles/sampletab.txt			// an example that all the hadoop fs commands can be executed din the grunt console
	records = LOAD '/pigfiles/sampletab.txt' AS (year:chararray, temperature:int, quality:int);    //  loads the file in the records field
	DUMP records;  // dumps records on console
		(1950,0,1)
		(1950,22,1)
		(1950,-11,1)
		(1949,111,1)
		(1949,78,1)
	filtered_records = FILTER records BY temperature != 9999 AND quality IN (0,1,4,5,9);
	DUMP filtered_records;
